todo:

	setup notebook and display cropped images: heck that they are reasonable
	finish making dictionary
	script to find total number of items and create id lists of train,val and test
	write option to supply distractors and ids: find nice way of writing this options: e.g. stream of dicts or something?
	give stream an argument for which set of ids to iterate over
